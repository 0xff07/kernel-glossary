# L2 State

## Entering L2

Enter the L2/L3 Ready state first. And if the `Vaux` is availabe, the Link enter the `L2` state.

At this state, the main power is no longer available. There's only `Vaux`. Can only be woken up by side band signal (`WAKE#`) or beacon signal.

## Exiting L2

Needs to start from `Detect` and redo all the link training before the link can reach `L0` again.
