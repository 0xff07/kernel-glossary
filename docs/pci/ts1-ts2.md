# TS1 and TS2

Note that training after a reset starts in Gen 1 speed even if the function is capable of higher speed. Gen 1 speed uses 8b/10b encoding, so the Link Trainig process at this stage also uses the 8b/10b version of `TS1` and `TS2`, instead of the 128b/130b ones that the Gen 3 speed (and above) use. Only when the Link enters `L0` and change the speed through the `Recovery` can the Link starts using the 128b/130b version of `TS1` and `TS2`.

## Common fields

## In 8b/10b encoding

## In 128b/130b encoding
