# L3 State

## Entering L3

Enter the L2/L3 Ready state first. And if there's no `Vaux` on the hardware, the Link enters `L3` state.

At this state, the main power is no longer available. Can only be woken up by side band signal (`WAKE#`).

## Exiting L3

Needs to start from `Detect` and redo all the link training before the link can reach `L0` again.
