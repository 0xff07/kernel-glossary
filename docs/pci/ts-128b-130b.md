# TS1 and TS2 (128b/130b)

Note that the fist few link training states the link always work in Gen 1 speed, so they always use the 8b/10b version of TS1 and TS2, instead of the 128b/130b version. This is true even if they support Gen 3 speed and above, which use 128b/130b encoding. Only when the link enters L0 and change the speed through the Recovery state can the link starts using the 128b/130b encoding that Gen 3 speed (and after) uses.
