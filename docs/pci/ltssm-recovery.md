# Recovery

The general pattern for a `Recovery` would look like:

1. Enter `Recovery` by sending `TS1`: also fill the fields in the `TS1` to indicate the reason and details to enter `Recovery` (e.g. `speed_change` ot not? `autonomous_change` or not?)
2. `Recovery.RecvrLock`: achieve bit lock and symbol lock by exchanging TS1.
3. `Recovery.RecvrCfg`: the actual stage where meaningful communication happens. Negotiate what both sides would like to do by exchanging TS2.
4. Once both the agreement is reached, switch to the next state and starting doing that.
